What is Machine Learning?
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised Learning:
It refers to algorithms that learn x to y mappings. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That include the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output of label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output.

In all of these applications, you will first train your model with examples of inputs x and the right answers, that is the labels y. After the model has learned from these input, output, or x and y pairs, they can take a brand new input x, something it has never seen before, and try to produce the appropriate corresponding output y.

By getting the data, a model can easily predict the price of a house of any size using this information or plotting graph of that particular size. For example, if a person chooses a house of 750 feet in size then the price will be predicted by analysing the lesser and higher values which means it must be between 180k to 210k by comparing with the other values. It is an example of a particular type of supervised learning called regression. By regression, we are trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers such as the house prices in this example.
